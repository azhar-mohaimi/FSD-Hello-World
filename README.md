# Web Assessment

Now this is real test of my understanding on what we've covered so far. I did not refer to the practice4.html as I wanted to see where I really stand as well. I like how when there are bootstrap templates required, pretty straightforward in section 3 (although I spent hours using wrong components and adding individual cards then realized there is card-deck). 

The second and last sections however, is a real test of patience. I tried containers, rows and columns, card-deck, individual cards but I couldnt figure out the placement. I searched for solutions online and understood what was needed in the code but nothing worked after i inserted the video. My project mates couldnt answer my queries either.

This is the result of almost a full day's worth of work. If given more time, the end result would be better. Its eye opening at least, from knowing my own understanding of css and bootstrap to the frustration of having a code that doesnt work. This assessment is painful but I appreciate what I've gained from it.
